# Persian Web Scraper

A scrapper to scrape popular persian websites. This is intended to be used as a tool to create corpora for Persian language. The scrapper supports Socks5 in order to rotate requests between multiple IPs

## Motivation
GPT3 as the first successful large language model has made it evident that training very large language models on extensively large text corpora results in useful models that perform various NLP tasks without any actual training. One of the two main reasons for this to become possible is the structure of the training data i.e. an extensively large text corpora. As pointed out in the GPT3 paper, large text corpora contains different contexts each with suitably large number of examples that enable the models to do -- what they call -- "in-context learning". 

Currently, most of the popular large Persian corpora are in raw text format without any meta-data so it is difficult to select parts of them for different NLP tasks and more importantly to build up a large text corpora containing properly sized sub-contexts to enable training large language models with zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities. PersianWebScrapper has been developed to address this issue. This scrapper keeps the meta-data associated with texts and also preserves the structure of the original text to enable gathering large corpora of text that contain sub-contexts with sufficiently large tails. In each article these meta-data are provided along with text in a JSON object:

 - publish date
 - title
 - surtitle, subtitle/lead, summary (if provided)
 - content with meta-information such as type(paragraph, heading, blockquote, etc.) and link references
 - comments with author, date, content (if available)
 - keywords (if provided)
 - catgory (if any)

## Usage
PersianWebScrapper can be used both local and in container

### Local
nodejs v18 or above is required to run the scraper. The following command runs the scraper:

```
yarn dev && yarn start [SUPPORTED_DOMAIN] [options]
```

Options are: 
   - --configFile, -c FILE_PATH:  
       A json config file as described [here](#config-file)  [optional] [default:"./.config"]
   - --verbosity, -v LEVEL        
       set verbosity level from 0 to 10 [optional] [default: 4 = progress]
   - --delay, -d SECONDS          
       Delay between requests to same address in seconds [optional] [default: 1 second]
   - --max-concurent, -m COUNT    
       max concurrent requests [optional] [default: 1 = single]
   - --proxies, -p RANGE          
       proxy ports to be used can be a single Socks5 port or range (ex.32001-32005)[optional] [default: not set]
   - --hostIP IP                  
       proxy host IP to be used mostly used on docker based version [optional] [default: not set]
   - --url, -u URL                
       URL to be retrieved just to check if data retrieval works fine [optional]
   - --logPath, -l                
       Path to store error logs [optional] [default: ./log]
   - --runQuery QUERY_STRING
       SQLQuery to run on domain-specific SQLiteDB [optional]

### Container
To create the docker images use the following shell script:

```
    ./buildDockerImages.sh $REGISTRY
```
and to use it create a container and run it using the following command:

```
    docker run -d \
           --name CONTAINER_NAME \
           -v$DB_PATH/:/db \
           -v$CORPORA_PATH:/corpora \
           -v$LOG_PATH:/log \
           --mount type=bind,source=$PATH2CONFIG/config.json,target=/etc/config.json \
           $REGISTRY/webscrap/scrapper:latest \
           node .build/index.js CONTAINER_NAME -c /etc/config.json \
           $OPTION_1 $OPTION_2 $OPTION_3 $OPTION_4 ... $OPTION_n
```

you can also use scripts provided in the scripts folder to run the scraper on multiple domains

## Configuration 
Config file is optional but helps to provide all your scrappers with same base configuration options. It is a JSON file with following fields which again, are all optional:

```
{
    debugVerbosity: 4,
    debugDB: false,
    showInfo: true,
    showWarnings: true,
    maxConcurrent: 1,
    db: "./db",
    corpora: "./corpora",
    proxies: 3302-3306,
    hostIP: 172.17.0.1,
    logPath: "./log",
    compact: false
}
```

## Output structure
PersianWebScrapper scrapes whole contents of the target site in order to find all internal links but will store just articles which has at least a Title. Also it will store whole URLs and their scrapping status in a local SQLite DB. JSON schema for the articles is as follows 

```
{
    url: string,                //Article normalized URL
    category: {
        original: string        //Category as specified by the article
        textType: string        //Main content textType, can be: Formal, Informal, Hybrid, Unknown
        major: string           //Major category can be: News, QA (Question & Answer), Literature, Forum, Weblog, SocialMedia, Doc, Undefined
        minor?: string          //Minor category (see source code for list of avaialable minor categories)
        subminor?: string       //Subminor category (see source code for list of avaialable minor and subminor categories)
    },          
    date: string,               //Article publish date (if specified)
    title: string,              //Title of the article
    aboveTitle?: string,        //Surtitle or any text provided before Title
    subtitle?: string,          //Subtitle or Lead (if provided)
    summary?: string,           //Summary (if provided)
    content?: IntfText[],       //An array containing main article each item structure will be 
                                //{ text: string, type: enuTextType, ref?: string } 
                                //where ref is just for items provided with a hyperlink
    comments?: IntfComment[]    //An array of comments (if any) in the following structure: 
                                //{ text: string, author?: string, date?: string }
    images?: IntfImage[],       //List of image URLs used in the article with their alt-texts.
                                //{ src: string, alt?: string }
    qa? : {                     //If the site has Question/Answer each item will consist of:
        q: IntfComment,         //Question part { text: string, author?: string, date?: string }
        a?: IntfComment[]       //Answers part 
    }[],
    tags?: string[],            //List of tags provided with the article
}
```

## Contribution
Configuring scrapper to scrap new WebSites is also easy.

1. First check if the sites is based on one of the popular CMS portals such as: 
    - [Asam](https://aasaam.com/product/cms)
    - [IranDrupal](https://irandrupal.com/)
    - [IranSamaneh](https://iransamaneh.com/)
    - [Nastooh](https://www.nastooh.ir/)
    - [StudioKhabar](http://www.news-studio.com/)

2. Add new item to ```enuDomains``` in ```interface.ts```
3. Create an instance of clsScrapper or one of the predefined portal classes
4. Configure or overwrite preconfigured properties as follows: 
```

    },
    //An optional function to preprocess HTML and remove extra parts or any other preprocessing
    preHTMLParse?: (html: string) => string
}
``` 

You can also override the following methods:  

- Initialization method mostly used for sites behind CDN which need warmup
```
    async init(): Promise<boolean> { return true }
```    

- A method to capture and ignore complex text nodes in content (ex. check khabaronline)
```
textNodeMustBeIgnored(textEl: HTMLElement, index: number, allElements: HTMLElement[])
```    

- A method to add extra headers to each request 
```
extraHeaders()
```    

- A method to create initial cookies for each proxy (ex. check alef.ir)
```
async initialCookie(proxy?: IntfProxy, url?: string): Promise<string | undefined>
```    

- A method to nomalize a path by removing extra items or discard the path. There are many examples in the code
```
protected normalizePath(url: URL, conf?: IntfURLNormaliziztionConf): string 
```

- A method to normalize original category string
```
public normalizeCategoryImpl(cat: string | undefined): string | undefined 
```

- A method to convert category string into predefined categories and subcategories
```
public mapCategoryImpl(category: string|undefined, catFirstPart :string, catSecondPart: string, url: string): IntfMappedCatgory 
```


## Corpus
We have used this scrapper to scrap some popular Persian websites and created a large Persian corpus which has been published on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Targoman/TLPC). More information about this corpus in Persian languyage can be obtained from [Targoman Large Persian Corpus (TLPC) page](https://oss.targoman.ir/TLPC)
